    <p>Mix 2 cups flour, 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp baking powder, and ½ tsp salt. In another bowl, whisk 2 eggs, 1¾ cups milk, ½ cup melted butter (or oil), and 1 tsp vanilla. Combine wet and dry ingredients, then cook in a preheated, greased waffle iron for 3-5 minutes until golden. Serve with syrup, butter, or your favorite toppings.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups milk (whole or 2%)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted butter (unsalted) or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Non-stick cooking spray or butter for greasing the waffle iron</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Start by preheating your waffle iron according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Usually, it takes about 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li> In another bowl, beat the eggs. Then, add milk, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract. Whisk everything until smooth.

          </li>
        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease the waffle iron with non-stick spray or a little butter. Pour the batter into the preheated waffle iron, making sure not to overfill it. Close the waffle iron and cook according to the iron’s instructions, typically 3-5 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp.</li> 
        <li> Carefully remove the waffles and serve immediately with your favorite toppings such as butter, syrup, whipped cream, fresh fruit, or powdered sugar.</li>
    </ol>
