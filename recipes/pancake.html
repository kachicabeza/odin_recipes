    <p>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk milk, egg, and butter, then combine with dry ingredients. Pour batter onto a heated, greased skillet. Cook until bubbles form, flip, and cook until golden. Serve with syrup.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Mix wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, egg, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. The batter may have a few lumps, which is fine.</li>
        <li> Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes per side.</li> 
        <li> Serve warm with syrup, butter, or your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
